      <h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube</a></h3>
      <p>YouTube is a large, media-rich video platform used for streaming, discovery, and content hosting. It delivers videos, channels, recommendations, and account-based features.</p>
      <ul class="crap-list">
        <li><strong>Contrast</strong> — YouTube generally uses strong contrast between text and backgrounds for readability, and video thumbnails use high-contrast imagery so content stands out.</li>
        <li><strong>Repetition</strong> — The site applies consistent patterns (thumbnail grid, player chrome, channel headers) across pages which helps users form expectations.</li>
        <li><strong>Alignment</strong> — Elements are well-aligned in predictable grid layouts; player controls and metadata are consistently placed which supports scanning and interaction.</li>
        <li><strong>Proximity</strong> — Related controls (title, channel, metadata, subscribe button) are grouped close to the player; recommendations are visually separated so users can distinguish primary content from related items.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Assessment: YouTube follows the CRAP principles closely — strong contrast and consistent repetition make content easy to scan. Alignment and proximity are well-handled in the player and listing pages. Its scale and personalization introduce some complexity, but overall the design supports user goals effectively.</p>

      <h3><a href="https://www.friv.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Friv</a></h3>
      <p>Friv is a miscellaneous game-portal site that serves many lightweight browser games via a simple tile interface and lots of third-party content. The visual presentation is cluttered and inconsistent.</p>
      <ul class="crap-list">
        <li><strong>Contrast</strong> — Contrast is often low or chaotic, with many colorful tiles and backgrounds competing for attention which can make it hard to focus.</li>
        <li><strong>Repetition</strong> — Repetition is limited; different tiles and external embeds use widely varying styles, so patterns are hard to learn.</li>
        <li><strong>Alignment</strong> — Alignment is inconsistent: advertising, game tiles, and text blocks frequently collide or are offset, producing a scattered layout.</li>
        <li><strong>Proximity</strong> — Related items (game title, play button, ads) are sometimes separated or mixed with unrelated content, which reduces clarity about what to click or expect.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Assessment: Friv largely fails the CRAP principles — low/competing contrast, poor repetition, inconsistent alignment, and mixed proximity make it hard for users to quickly understand or trust the interface. The site feels noisy and crowded as a result.</p>
